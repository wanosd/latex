\chapter{Implementation and Testing}
\label{impltesting}

\section{Introduction}

This chapters focuses on the implementation of the application, with the focus on the application entities, and how they were configured. Due to the overlapping nature of the application, concepts may be mentioned earlier than explained, but references will be made. 

\section{Application Entities}
\subsection{Users - Persistence}

The \textit{User} class represents every user account within the application. (Link to appendice showing class attributes). This section will focus on a regular user, how it is configured within the application in terms of bean definition and persistence. 

Firstly, as shown in line one of Figure ~\ref{fig:userDef}, the class needs to be configured as a \textit{Component} for the application. This ensures that the Spring framework considers the User class as one for auto-detection, as the use of class path scanning and annotations prevalent within this application. The framework instantiates this bean, or object, automatically, without the developer having to use the \textit{new} keyword.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
@Component
@Entity
@Table(name="users")
public class User {
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue
	int id;
	
	@NotNull(groups={PersistenceValidationGroup.class, FormValidationGroup.class})
	@Pattern(regexp=".+\\@.+\\..+", message="This does not appear to be a valid email address", groups={PersistenceValidationGroup.class, FormValidationGroup.class})
	@Column(name="username")
	String username;
	
	@Size(min=5, max=45, message="Named must be between 5 and 45 characters",groups={PersistenceValidationGroup.class, FormValidationGroup.class})
	@Column(name="name")
	String name;
	
	@Column(name="password")
	@Size(min=5, max=15, message="Password must be between 5 and 15 characters", groups=FormValidationGroup.class)
	String password;
	
	@Column(name="gender")
	String gender;
	
	@Pattern(regexp="08[35679]([0-9]{7})", message="Number must be in the format 083, 085, 086, 087, 089 and 7 additional numbers eg 0851234567", groups={PersistenceValidationGroup.class, FormValidationGroup.class})
	@Column(name="contact_num")
	String contact_num;
	//Class truncated. Some repetitive attributes omitted
	//Getters and Setters below here.
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{User Class Definition and Configuration}
\label{fig:userDef}
\end{table}

The \textit{Entity} and \textit{Table} annotations that belong to the javax.persistance package. These annotations are used by Hibernate in order to manage and persist the class. The \textit{@Table} annotation has a 'name' attribute that refers to the schema table the class maps to. There are two ways that an attribute can be assigned to a table column by Hibernate. Both methods are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:userDef}. An annotation may be placed on the attribute in order to specify a column name. Line 12 in Figure ~\ref{fig:userDef} shows the username attribute being mapped to the username column within the User database schema. The other way of specifying where an attribute should be persisted is to ensure that the attribute name matches the column name within the table. This implicitly allows Hibernate to map a class, without having to explicitly define the mapping for the persistence framework.

The User class has a number of attribute constraints placed upon it. There are two types of constraints within this application: \textit{FormValidationGroup} and \textit{PersistenceValidationGroup}. These are interface classes with no attributes that just serve as identifiers. As shown in lines 10, 14, 19 and 25 of Figure ~\ref{fig:userDef}, an attribute may be constrained by one or more groups. An annotation, from the javax.validation.constraints, is applied to the attribute. The annotations used within this application were as detailed in Table ~\ref{fig:classConstraints}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    Constraint Name & Description\\ \hline
    Pattern & Ensures the value within the attribute conforms to a regular expression\\ \hline
    Min & Ensures the value within the attribute has a minimum length\\ \hline
	Max & Ensures the value within the attribute has a maximum length\\ \hline
	NotNull & Ensures the value within the attribute does not have a null value\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Class Constraints}
\label{fig:classConstraints}
\end{table}

These validation package interfaces provide a \textit{groups} attribute, which is an array of objects. The \textit{FormValidationGroup} and \textit{PersistenceValidationGroup} are passed to this attribute. When using this attribute within the application, such as the creation of a user within a form, the MemberController class applies validation to the user input. The reason for having two groups of validation within this application is due to security. In every application, it is advisable to perform encryption on sensitive data, such as passwords. Within the scope of this application, user passwords were defined as being between 5 and 15 characters long, with no restriction to the content of the password. For example, a user password with 8 characters would pass form validation with no issues. When the PasswordEncoder bean is applied to the string prior to persistence, it will result in a value like \textit{'acb172137243c0b931321d7645dc4b2f5575a30ab48c31c2efb8346385ae0547d11b1d8de333215b'}, a value much longer than 15 characters. This will cause a failure with Hibernate persistence. This is because Hibernate works at a class level, and does take note of the constraints placed upon the class, while JDBC does not. The constraints that JDBC takes note of are those taken directly from the database itself. In this application, passing form validation is sufficient, as there are security annotations placed on the Service classes that manage data persistence. An example of how the controller handles validation is shown later in Figure ~\ref{fig:memberController}. 

Alongside class configuration, it is also necessary to configure Hibernate to scan the packages that contain entities, as detailed in Figure ~\ref{fig:hibernateConfig}. This is done through the creation of a sessionFactory bean, which uses the AnnotationSessionFactoryBean class. This bean is responsible for the creation of session instances within the application, though each application usually only has one session. It is an immutable object, and cannot be changed once it is created, so proper configuration of classes to facilitate object-relational mapping is important.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
<bean id="sessionFactory"
class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.annotation.AnnotationSessionFactoryBean">
<property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"></property>
<property name="hibernateProperties">
	<props>
		<prop key="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect</prop>
	</props>
</property>
<property name="packagesToScan">
	<list>
		<value>users</value>
	</list>
</property>
</bean>
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Hibernate SessionFactory Configuration}
\label{fig:hibernateConfig}
\end{table}

The Form Validation is provided by the Spring Security file, which will be examined in detail in the Administration Implementation section on page ~\pageref{sec:adminImp}. As discussed previously, there are a number of validation constraints placed on the \textit{User} class. Spring provides a facility to ensure these constraints are enforced, and to also provide a positive user experience. It does this through the use of a BindingResult object. This object holds a record of any errors from the form that the user populates. The controller that deals with the form will check the BindingResult object for errors, and can respond appropriately. In order for this to work, both the Controller and the form, see Figure ~\ref{fig:memberController} need to be defined clearly. The form needs to be created  using the Spring Framework form tag library, and errors needs to be specified for each input within the form. \pagebreak

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
<!-- Excerpt from the User registration form. Formatting removed for clarity --!>
<sf:form id="details" method="post" action="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/register" commandName="member">
Name <sf:input name = "name" path="name" type="text"/>
<sf:errors path="name" cssClass="error"></sf:errors>
Password <sf:input id="password" name = "password" path="password" type="password"/>
<sf:errors path="password" cssClass="error"></sf:errors>
</sf:form>

//Method from the MembersController class
//This method is responsible for validating the form that users complete to register.
@RequestMapping(value = "/register", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String doRegister(Model model,
@Validated(FormValidationGroup.class) @ModelAttribute("member") User member, BindingResult result) {
if (result.hasErrors()) {
	return "createmembers"; // if the result has errors, go back to create page
}
if (userService.exists(member.getUsername())) {
	result.rejectValue("username", "Duplicate Key",
	"This email address has already been used");
	return "createmembers";
	//if the email address already exists, return with this message.
}
	else {
		try {
			member.setAuthority("ROLE_MEMBER");
			userService.create(member);
			return "registerSuccess";
			//successful creation of member
			} catch (Exception e) {
				return "error";
			}
		}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{User Registration Form}
\label{fig:memberController}
\end{table}

Within this application, the Service layer is responsible for the Controller communicating with the DAO layer to persist objects like the User class. Since Hibernate is configured at a class level, in relation to attributes and column names, there is no need for any INSERT or UPDATE statements. The current session, see Figure ~\ref{fig:getSession} is returned to the DAO object via the configured bean, and the necessary methods, such as save() and delete(), are called upon it. An object must be passed to the \textit{save()} method of the current sessionFactory object, detailed in ~\ref{fig:hibernateConfig}. 

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
public Session session(){
	logger.info("Session Factory returning current session.....");
	return sessionFactory.getCurrentSession();
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{UserDAO getSession()}
\label{fig:getSession}
\end{table}

In the case of the User object, the password needs to be encoded prior to the object being persisted by the session(). In order to encode password, a bean responsible for the encoding must be defined within the application context, shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:passwordEncoder}. Spring provides a class that allows passwords to be encoded, and the bean for this class is defined within a security-context file.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
<bean id="passwordEncoder"
class="org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StandardPasswordEncoder">
</bean>
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Password Encoder Definition}
\label{fig:passwordEncoder}
\end{table}

This Spring defined class provides an implementation for encoding data using SHA-256 hashing with 1024 iterations, with a random 8 byte salt value. This object then calls \textit{encode()} on the value passed from the form filled by the user. As a result, the actual password is never stored in the database, just an encrypted form of it, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:userPersist}. Once the password is encoded (Line 4, ~\ref{fig:userPersist}), the session() object can save the object. Due to the class configuration, there is no need to specify any database schema information within the DAO classes.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
@Transactional
public void createUser(User user) {
	user.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode(user.getPassword()));
	session().save(user);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Persisting User Object with Encoded Password}
\label{fig:userPersist}
\end{table}

\subsection{Timetable - Persistence Changes}

One of the most difficult features to implement within the application was the Timetable. While the goal was to create a timetable suitable for Monaleen GAA Tennis Club, it was desirable that the timetable retain the ability to have some dynamic features, not pre-set features that were not user definable. One issue this raised was how to handle a varying number of slots in each day. If a user could defined 10 slots a day, how would be store this in such a way that a user could also define a timetable with 20 slots a day. Hibernate was able to facilitate this design with considerably less input from a developer.

The solution implemented in this application was to use List objects to store the values for each day. There would be seven lists in the Timetable class, one for each day, as per Figure ~\ref{fig:timetableConfig}.


\begin{lstlisting}
@Entity
@Component
@Table(name = "timetable")
public class MonaleenTTV1 implements Timetable {
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue
	private int id;
	/**
	* Other Attributes Here
	**/
	
	@ElementCollection
	@CollectionTable (name = "monday", joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="id"))
	private List<String> monday;
	
	@ElementCollection
	@CollectionTable (name = "tuesday", joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="id"))
	private List<String> tuesday;
	
	@ElementCollection
	@CollectionTable (name = "wednesday", joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="id"))
	private List<String> wednesday;
	
	@ElementCollection
	@CollectionTable (name = "thursday", joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="id"))
	private List<String> thursday;
	
	@ElementCollection
	@CollectionTable (name = "friday", joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="id"))
	private List<String> friday;
	
	@ElementCollection
	@CollectionTable (name = "saturday", joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="id"))
	private List<String> saturday;
	
	@ElementCollection
	@CollectionTable (name = "sunday", joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="id"))
	private List<String> sunday;
	
	//getters and setters
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Timetable Class List Configuration}
\label{fig:timetableConfig}
\end{table}

This results in the Timetable object being made up of 8 database tables. The core of the class is stored in the 'Timetable' database table. This table contains the primary keys and all other attributes, such as name, number of slots, timetable series. The seven other tables each represent a collection within the Timetable class. Each of these tables has a non unique, foreign key that ties it back to the central table. For example, if we were to create a Timetable with 10 slots, with the primary key being 1, each of the collection tables would have 10 entries. Each of these entries would have an id of 1, to match the primary key in the core table, plus a value, such as 'Free Court'. The position in the table corresponds to the position within the collection class. 

The following example, in Figure ~\ref{fig:ttdb}, shows a Timetable configured with two slots. Upon creation, a series is created for each timetable. Each series contains 52 timetables, one for each week. The currently displayed timetable is determined by its position in the series in relation to the current week of the year, as shown by the Java Calendar class. The 'preview' attribute determines how far ahead the application will display the next number of timetables. In this example, the next three weeks of timetables are available for viewing and booking. This allows the administrator to dynamically restrict how far in advance users can book slots.

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l | l | l | l | l | p{.8cm} |}
    \hline
    pid & name & slots & startTime & endTime & enabled & preview & series & total\\ \hline
    1 & Court One Week 1 & 2 & 8 & 22 & 1 & 3 & 1 & 52\\ \hline
	2 & Court One Week 2 & 2 & 8 & 22 & 0 & 3 & 1 & 52\\ \hline
	3 & Court One Week 3 & 2 & 8 & 22 & 0 & 3 & 1 & 52\\ \hline
	4 & Court One Week 4 & 2 & 8 & 22 & 0 & 3 & 1 & 52\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
	\caption{Timetable Core Database Table}
	\label{fig:ttdb}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
\begin {center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l | p{.8cm} |}
	\hline
	pid & monday \\ \hline
	1 & Free Court \\ \hline
	1 & Free Court \\ \hline
	2 & Tournament \\ \hline
	2 & Free Court \\ \hline
	3 & User Booking \\ \hline

	4 & Training \\ \hline
	4 & Free Court \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Timetable Storage Table for Monday Collection}
\end{table}

While the table structure of the \textit{User} and \textit{Timetable} differ considerably, since Hibernate deals with objects, that have table structures defined within their classes, there is no change to the way the Timetable is saved and updated, as per Figure ~\ref{timetableHibernate}. Using JDBC, there would have been 8 SQL queries to save to each of the 8 table, increasing the risk of bugs within the application, or invalid data being saved or retrieved.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
@Transactional
public void createTimetable(Timetable t) {
	session().save(t);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Hibernate Save Timetable}
\label{fig:timetableHibernate}
\end{table}






\subsection{Tournaments and Events}

The third major area of the site were the \textit{Tournament} and \textit{Event} classes. The structure and configuration of these classes are not different from the \textit{User} or \textit{Timetable} classes. 

\subsubsection{Tournament}

The \textit{Tournament} class is configured similar to the \textit{Timetable} class, in that it has a secondary table which contains a list of members who have registered for the tournament. The key area for tournament implementation was for the application to differentiate between the various states of the tournament, such as registration being enabled, yet the tournament not having started yet. It was also important that the tournament could link up with the Timetable system, in order to book slots to play the tournament. In this regards, a tournament was required to manage an Event object, see Figure ~\ref{fig:tourCreate}, and to ensure that no ambiguity was present when dealing with multiple tournaments and possible multiple timetables. It was also necessary for this to be self managing, in order to minimize administrator involvement. 

\begin{lstlisting}
@RequestMapping(value = "/registerTournament", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String doCreateTournament(
	Model model, BindingResult result,
	@Validated(FormValidationGroup.class) @ModelAttribute("tournament") Tournament t) {
	
	if (result.hasErrors()) {
		return "createTournament";
	} 
	if (tournamentService.exists(t.getTournamentName())){
		if (eventService.exists(t.getTournamentName())){
		result.rejectValue("tournamentName", "Duplicate Key",
		"An event of this name already exists");
		return "createTournament";
	}
	result.rejectValue("tournamentName", "Duplicate Key",
		"A tournament of this name already exists");
		return "createTournament";
		}
	else {
		try {
			tournamentService.create(t);
			eventCreation(t);
			logger.info("Tournament Created");
			return "tournamentSuccess";
		} catch (Exception e) {
		return "error";
	}
}
public void eventCreation(Tournament t){
	Event e = new Event();
	e.setName(t.getTournamentName());
	e.setAuthor(userService.emailToName(SecurityContextHolder.getContext()
	.getAuthentication().getName()));
	eventService.createEvent(e);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Tournament Creation}
\label{fig:tourCreate}
\end{table}

Deleting a tournament needed similar logic, as displayed in Figure ~\ref{fig:deleteTour}. Similar to the \textit{User} class, the Tournament name, much like the username, is used as a primary key, and can be recycled once a tournament is deleted. 

\begin{lstlisting}
	@RequestMapping("/confirmDelete")
	public String deleteTournament(Model model, HttpServletRequest request){
		Tournament t = tournamentService.getTournamentById(request
				.getParameter("tournamentID"));
		tournamentService.deleteTournament(t);
		eventService.deleteEvent(eventService.getEventIdByName(t.getTournamentName()));
		model.addAttribute("tour", tournamentService.getAllTournaments());
		return "deleteTournament";
	}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Delete Tournament}
\label{fig:deleteTour}
\end{table}	

Due to constraints on time within the final year project, it wasn't possible to fully flesh out this area of the site, though it was implemented in such a way to allow for extensibility such as an interface for the sorting of registered members into teams.

\subsubsection{Events}

Within the scope of this application, an \textit{Event} is any item that can be scheduled within the Timetable object. As with the \textit{Tournament} class, the \textit{Event} class is configured much like the \textit{User} and \textit{Timetable} classes. One event that is required by all versions of the Timetable is the 'Free Court' event. This event is created by default (see Figure ~\ref{fig:createEvent}) either the first time an administrator attempts to create an Event, or to create a Timetable. An Event has two attributes: a name and an author. In the case of a system event, the name will be the login of the person who booked the timetable slot, while the author is defined as \textit{BOOKING SYSTEM}. For an administrator event, the name is defined by that administrator, while the author is listed as the administrator who created the event.

\begin{lstlisting}
@RequestMapping(value = "/saveEvent", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String saveEvent(Model model, @ModelAttribute("event") Event e,
	BindingResult result) {
	if (eventService.getEventById(1).equals(null)){
		e.setName("Free Court");
		e.setAuthor(userService.emailToName(SecurityContextHolder
		.getContext().getAuthentication().getName()));
		e.setEnabled(true);
		eventService.createEvent(e);
	}
	logger.info("Event Save Method....");
	if (result.hasErrors()) {
		return "createEvent";
	}
	if (eventService.exists(e.getName())) {
		result.rejectValue("name", "Duplicate Key",
		"This Event Name has already been used.");
		return "createEvent";
	} else {
		e.setAuthor(userService.emailToName(SecurityContextHolder
		.getContext().getAuthentication().getName()));
		e.setEnabled(false);
		eventService.createEvent(e);
		return viewEvent(model);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Event Creation}
\label{fig:createEvent}
\end{table}

In order for an event to show up as an option when creating, or editing, a timetable, it must be enabled, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:enableEvent}. This implementation allows the administrator to pre-create events for later use without overcrowding the timetable.

\begin{lstlisting}
@RequestMapping("/changeEventStatus")
public String changeEventStatus(Model model, HttpServletRequest request) {
	Event e = (Event) eventService.getEventById(Integer.valueOf(request
	.getParameter("eventID")));
	if (e.isEnabled()) {
		e.setEnabled(false);
		eventService.updateEvent(e);
		return viewEvent(model);
	} else {
		e.setEnabled(true);
		eventService.updateEvent(e);
		return viewEvent(model);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Change Event Status}
\label{fig:enableEvent}
\end{table} 	
	
	
\label{sec:adminImp}
\subsection{Administration - Security and Session Management}

The \textit{Administration} section of the application deals with the implementation, and configuration, of the security and session management aspects of the application. An administrator has the same structure as a \textit{User} and is defined by the \textit{Role} it has, as seen previously in Figure ~\ref{fig:secRoles}. These roles are configured through Spring Security, in which a specific database schema must be adhered to. By default, there should be two tables: \textit{users} and \textit{authorities}, with a foreign key constraint. In this application, as shown in Line 3, Figure ~\ref{fig:roleConfig}, this was modified to keep the user data within the same table.

\begin{lstlisting}
<security:authentication-provider>
<security:jdbc-user-service data-source-ref="dataSource"
id="jdbcUserService" authorities-by-username-query="select username, authority from users where binary username = ?" />
<security:password-encoder ref="passwordEncoder"></security:password-encoder>
</security:authentication-provider>
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Spring Role Configuration}
\label{fig:roleConfig}
\end{table}

The security within the application is controlled by the \textit{security-context.xml} file, which used Expression Based Access Control [EBAC] in order to restrict site access to relevant roles. EBAC allows complicated boolean logic to be encapsulated within a single expression, such as whether a user is authenticated or not. The base class used within this application is \textit{SecurityExpressionRoot}. These expressions are contained within the \textit{security-context.xml} file, as seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:secContext}. This configuration file is partly responsible for controller access to the mappings within the application. 

\begin{lstlisting}
<security:http use-expressions="true">
<security:intercept-url pattern="/static/**" access="permitAll" />
<security:intercept-url pattern="/images/**" access="permitAll" />
<security:intercept-url pattern="/createmembers" access="permitAll" />
<security:intercept-url pattern="/tournamentSuccess" access="hasAnyRole('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_COMMITTEE')" />
<security:intercept-url pattern="/createNews" access="hasAnyRole('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_COMMITTEE')" />
<security:intercept-url pattern="/members" access="isAuthenticated()" />
</security:http>
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Security Context File Excerpt}
\label{fig:secContext}
\end{table}

In addition to the expression level security, service-level security annotations are also in place. This gives the application a second layer of security, as it restricts the use of methods within the service layer to defined roles. This is configured within the \textit{security-context.xml} file, Figure ~\ref{fig:secAnnotate}, and is implemented, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:secAnonImpl}, within the service layer. These annotation use the same roles as defined previously within the application.

\begin{lstlisting}
<security:global-method-security secured-annotations="enabled"></security:global-method-security>
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Security Context Service Layer Annotation Configuration}
\label{fig:secAnnotate}
\end{table}

\begin{lstlisting}
@Service("timetableService")
public class TimetableService {

private TimetableDAO timetableDAO;

	@Autowired
	public void setTimetableDAO(TimetableDAO timetableDAO) {
		this.timetableDAO = timetableDAO;
	}
	
	@Secured("ROLE_ADMIN")
	public void create(Timetable t){
		timetableDAO.createTimetable(t);
	}
	
	@Secured({"ROLE_ADMIN", "ROLE_MEMBER", "ROLE_COMMITTEE", "ROLE_WARNING", "ROLE_SUSPEND"})
	public void update(Timetable t){
		timetableDAO.updateTimetable(t);
	}
	
	public List<Timetable> getAllTimetables(){
		return timetableDAO.listTimetables();
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Security Context Service Layer Annotation Implementation}
\label{fig:secAnonImpl}
\end{table}

In the implementation shown above, there are some items to note: the \textit{Service} and \textit{Autowired} annotations. The \textit{Service} annotation allows implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning. The package that contains the Service classes is defined within another XML file, \textit{service-context.xml} within this application, Figure ~\ref{fig:serviceContext}. This file configures Spring to look for Service classes via annotations, and where to look for them.

\begin{lstlisting}
<context:annotation-config></context:annotation-config>
<context:component-scan base-package="service"></context:component-scan>
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Service Context Configuration}
\label{fig:serviceContext}
\end{table}



\section{Model View Controller}
\subsection{Controller Layer}

\subsection{Models within the Spring MVC Framework}

\subsection{View Layer}
\subsubsection{Apache Tiles Configuration and Implementation}

Apache Tiles is configured within the web application core XML file. There are two classes that the configuration is concerned with: TilesViewResolver and TileConfigurer. Both are declared as beans within the configuration file and automatically created when the application is launched. The primary function of the ViewResolver is to take in a String value, and return the relevant \textit{RequestMapping} value within the application. These mappings are defined within the Controller classes of the application. The TilesConfigurer object, see Figure ~\ref{fig:tilesXML}, takes one parameter: a location of the template that the default tile, and its subsequent children, will use. \newline

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
<bean id="tilesViewResolver"
	class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.tiles2.TilesViewResolver">
</bean>

<bean id="tilesConfig"
	class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.tiles2.TilesConfigurer">
	<property name="definitions">
	<list>
		<value>/WEB-INF/layout/default.xml</value>
	</list>
	</property>
</bean>
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Apache Tiles Configuration}
\label{fig:tilesXML}
\end{table}

The default tile consists of a number of sections identified by a specific tag. These tags correspond to values within the tile layout configuration file. Using a version of inheritance, these can be overwritten and replaced with other pages in order to change the content of a page, while maintaining cohesion across the design of the application. 

The following examples shows the implementation within the configuration file. The first section of code is the overall template. This specifies the default values that make up a JSP page within the application. The second segment of code is the the definition for the initial home page for the web application. By the inclusion of the \textit{extends="users.base"} within the definition tags, it is defining the index as a sub class of the users.base definition. Consequently, it is possible to override any of the attributes within the users.base definition. In this example, the title and content of the default page are being overridden with different values in order construct a more suitable page. The header, links and footer however remain the same, and will do so will all pages following this format, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:tilesConfig}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
<definition name="users.base" template="/WEB-INF/templates/default.jsp">
	<put-attribute name="title" value="Monaleen Tennis Club - Default Template"></put-attribute>
	<put-attribute name="header" value="/WEB-INF/tiles/header.jsp"></put-attribute>
	<put-attribute name="links" value="/WEB-INF/tiles/links.jsp"></put-attribute>
	<put-attribute name="content" value="/WEB-INF/tiles/content.jsp"></put-attribute>
	<put-attribute name="footer" value="/WEB-INF/tiles/footer.jsp"></put-attribute>
</definition>

<definition name="index" extends="users.base">
	<put-attribute name="title" value="Monaleen Tennis Club - Home Page"></put-attribute>
	<put-attribute name="content" value="/WEB-INF/tiles/index.jsp"></put-attribute>
</definition>

<definition name="admin" extends="users.base">
	<put-attribute name="title" value="Monaleen Tennis Club - Admin"></put-attribute>
	<put-attribute name="content" value="/WEB-INF/tiles/admin.jsp"></put-attribute>
</definition>
\end{lstlisting}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{JSTL}

JSTL is used within the application to manage how information was displayed. It was preferred, during the development of the application, that all of the logic be handled at the Controller level, and that the JSP pages would resolve the models passed to it into the view seen by the user. It was not desirable for the pages to contain JSP directives, or to use the implicit objects contained within JSP pages. 

The main tags used within the application were the JSTL Core tags.  These tags allow the usage of conditional statements and the definition of parameters within the JSP page. In order to use this technology, the relevant jar must be made available in the build path or within the Maven dependencies of the project. A declaration, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:jstldec} must be included in all JSP pages that wish to make use of the tags also.\newline

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
<%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core"%>
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{JSTL Tag Library Declaration}
\label{fig:jstldec}
\end{table}

Within the application, the controller will create a model and pass it to the JSP page. The page uses the JSTL tags to manage and display relevant information from the model, and user actions based on the information contained within. The example below is taken from the Timetable display page from the application.\newline

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    Model Name & Summary \\ \hline
    name & The username of the currently authenticated user  \\ \hline
    realName & The real name of the currently authenticated user\\ \hline
	bookings & The number of remaining bookings of the currently authenticated users\\ \hline
	date & The current week of the year and the current date. Calculated using separate method.\\ \hline
	next & The id number of the court following the current court, if applicable\\ \hline
    prev & The id number of the court preceding the current court, if applicable\\ \hline
	court & The current court, determined by the current week, provided by the java.util.Date class \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Model Attributes}
\end{table}
\pagebreak
\begin{lstlisting}
@RequestMapping(value = "/gotoCourt", method = RequestMethod.POST)
public String chooseCourt(Model model, HttpServletRequest request) {
	//abbreviated method to display court, logic removed
	//highlighting the attributes within the model
	model = addDateToTimetable(model, id));
	model.addAttribute("series",timetableService.getById(id).getSeries());
	model.addAttribute("name", SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getName());
	model.addAttribute("court", current);
	model.addAttribute("realname", name);
	model.addAttribute("bookings", left);
	if (seriesMatch(courtID, nextCourt)) {
		model.addAttribute("next", (current.getId() + 1));
	}
	if (seriesMatch(courtID, prevCourt)) {
		model.addAttribute("prev", (current.getId() - 1));
	}
	return "court";
}
\end{lstlisting}	

This example is an excerpt from the TimetableContoller class. The logic determining the values has been removed. This is to highlight how attributes are added to the model from within the controller. This is the information that the JSP page will have access to once it has been displayed.

The above code deals with the display of \textit{Monday} within the Timetable display page. In the \textit{c:forEach} tags, it loops through each value in the \textit{court.monday} list that has been passed to it by the controller. The size of this list is determined by the user when the timetable is created, and the number of slots per day is specified. If the current value being examined in the loop is equal to the value "Free Court", it will display a link to the Book Form mapping. This aspect of the Timetable Controller will check that a user has any remaining bookings left and respond as appropriate. In the event that the value in the list does not equal "Free Court", it will make a choice. If the currently authenticated user made the booking, it will display an option to remove their booking from the slot. Otherwise, it will give any other user an option to report the user as a "no show" should a user fail to show for a previously booked slot. \newline

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
<c:forEach var="row" varStatus="loop" items="${court.monday}">
<c:choose>
<c:when test='${row eq "Free Court"}'><tr>
<td class="inner"><form action="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/bookCourt"

<input type="hidden" value="monday" name="day" /> 
<input type="hidden" value="${court.id }" name="ttid" />
<input type="submit" value="Book">
</form></td></tr>
</c:when>
<c:otherwise><tr><td class="inner">${row}
<c:choose>
<c:when test="${name eq pageContext['request'].userPrincipal.name && row eq realname }">

\section{Logging the Application}

The logging for this application was provided by \textit{log4j.} Logging became very useful for tracking down, and isolating bugs, throughout the application. Since there were a considerable number of dependencies and different technologies working together, it rapidly became very difficult to see where errors originated from. Stack-traces quickly became unmanageable. \textit{Log4j} works by allowing the developer to view a number of logs of varying types within the application.
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    Log Type & Description \\ \hline
    INFO & Messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level  \\ \hline
    DEBUG & Fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application\\ \hline
	TRACE & Finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG\\ \hline
	WARN & Potentially harmful situations\\ \hline
	ERROR & Error events that might still allow the application to continue running\\ \hline
    FATAL & Very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Log Types}
\end{table}

\textit{Log4j} is configured with a properties file that allows you to see the various levels of logs displays by the applications running. Implementation of a logging system resolved a number of Spring Security issues within the web application. Spring Security, concerned with access rights to mappings within the application, did not output failed access attempts to the console. This made it very difficult to debug. When configuring \textit{Log4j} to catch the logs created by the security components, the application became much easier to debug. The properties file for this web application is detailed below.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, CONSOLE
log4j.appender.CONSOLE=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout=org.apache.log4j.SimpleLayout
log4j.logger.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG
log4j.logger.org.hibernate.type=TRACE
log4j.logger.org.springframework.security=DEBUG
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Log4j Configuration}
\end{table}

Logging can be implemented on a class by class basis. Within this application, it was used to display informational messages to the developer. These included items such as database access, objects being created and updated. In order to enable logging on a class, a logger must be instantiated with reference to the class that requires logging. The logger object then is called with a method corresponding to the type of log you wish to throw along with a message.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(UserDAO.class);

public Session session(){ 
	logger.info("Session Factory returning current session.....");
	return sessionFactory.getCurrentSession();
}

public List<User> getUsers() {
	logger.info("Selecting All Enabled Members....");
	return session().createQuery("from User where enabled = '1'").list();
}

public User getUserByName(String name) {
	Criteria crit = session().createCriteria(User.class);
	crit.add(Restrictions.eq("name", name)); 
	try{
	User user = (User) crit.uniqueResult();
	}
	catch(Exception e){
	logger.error{"Must be unique result : Thrown from UserDAO.getUserByName(String name));
	}
	return user;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Logger Usage within UserDAO.class}
\end{table}

\section{Configuration of the Application}

In order to begin implementation with the Spring MVC framework, there are a number of configuration files that are necessary. The core file is the \textit{web.xml} file. This file is responsible for the configuration for the framework. One of the key responsibilities is the definition of the context xml files, whose purpose will be elaborated on later. Different development profiles can be configured within this file in order to produce different development environments, such as production and testing environments. The configuration of this file within the application is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:springConfig} \newline 
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
<context-param>
<param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
<param-value>
	classpath:beans/dao-context.xml
	classpath:beans/service-context.xml
	classpath:beans/security-context.xml
</param-value>
 </context-param>
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Spring Configuration}
\label{fig:springConfig}
\end{table}

Of particular importance are the definition of the context parameters. In this project, there were three main context files.

\begin{itemize}
\item Data Access Object Context
\item Service Context
\item Security Context
\end{itemize}

The DAO Context file specifies the packages that contain the various DAO classes within the application. It also contains configurations for both the database connection details, and Hibernate configurations. Packages containing entity classes for Hibernate are specified within this context also. \newline

\begin{table}
\begin{lstlisting}
<property name="hibernateProperties">
<props>
<prop key="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect</prop>
</props>
</property>
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Hibernate Configuration}
\end{table}


The Service Context file is responsible for specifying the base package containing the Service classes necessary to facilitate the collaboration between the Controller classes and the DAO classes. This file specifies that annotations will be used to configure the Service classes.\newline

\begin{lstlisting}
<context:annotation-config></context:annotation-config>
<context:component-scan base-package="service"></context:component-scan>
\end{lstlisting}

The Security Context file is the larger of the three files, and is responsible for the security configuration of the web application. There are four main areas within the file that were used to configure the web application created in this project. \newline The User Service aspect of the configuration file is responsible for retrieving users and their authority within the scope of the web application. \newline The URL access configuration ensures that only users who are authorised to access certain portions of the site are allowed access. \newline The Security Annotations allow the creation of an extra level of security into an application. At class level, annotations can be placed on methods to further ensure that proper access is enforced throughout the application. \newline Lastly, the Security Context is responsible for creating the password encoder bean in which passwords are encoded, and decoded, upon account creation and login. This ensures that no passwords in plain text form are ever stored on either the server or the database within the web application \pagebreak

\begin{itemize}
\item User Service
\begin{lstlisting}
<security:authentication-manager>	
	<security:authentication-provider>
	<security:jdbc-user-service data-source-ref="dataSource"
		id="jdbcUserService" authorities-by-username-query="select username, authority from users where binary username = ?" />
	<security:password-encoder ref="passwordEncoder"></security:password-encoder>
	</security:authentication-provider>
</security:authentication-manager>
\end{lstlisting}
\item URL Access
\begin{lstlisting}
<security:intercept-url pattern="/timetable" access="permitAll"/>
<security:intercept-url pattern="/reportNoShow" access="permitAll"/>
<security:intercept-url pattern="/admin" access="hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')"/>
<security:intercept-url pattern="/approveMembers" access="hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')"/>
\end{lstlisting}
\item Security Annotation for Service Class
\begin{lstlisting}
<security:global-method-security secured-annotations="enabled"></security:global-method-security>
//Java Code from TimetableService class. 
//This code is invoked when booking a slot on the timetable and is only accessible by registered members.
@Secured({"ROLE_ADMIN", "ROLE_MEMBER", "ROLE_COMMITTEE", "ROLE_WARNING", "ROLE_SUSPEND"})
	public void update(Timetable t){
		timetableDAO.updateTimetable(t);
	}
\end{lstlisting}
\item Password Encoding
\begin{lstlisting}
<bean id="passwordEncoder"
class="org.springframework.security.crypto.password.StandardPasswordEncoder">
</bean>
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\section{Test Driven Development}

The primary method of testing was implemented using JUnit. A Test Suite of JUnit tests were prepared to test the key features of the application. A separate test database was constructed. It was important to ensure that the testing environment was using the same context files as the production environment. The test class had to be annotated to enforce this. While the context files were the same, the DataSource file has changed as a different database is being using in this environment.


\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
@ActiveProfiles("dev")
@ContextConfiguration(locations = { "file:src/main/java/beans/dao-context.xml",
"file:src/main/java/beans/security-context.xml",
"classpath:test/config/datasource.xml" })
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
public class HibernateTests {
	
	@Autowired
	private UserDAO userDAO;
	
	@Autowired
	private TournamentDAO tournamentDAO;
	
	@Autowired
	private DataSource dataSource;
	
	//Class truncated 
}

\end{lstlisting}
\caption{JUnit Test Example}
\end{table}

The database is then initialised to ensure the tests are being run against the same database, and that repeat tests are consistent.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
@Before
public void init(){
	JdbcTemplate jdbc = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);
	jdbc.execute("delete from users"); 
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{JUnit @Before Test Configuration}
\end{table}

In these example tests, the UserDAO is being tested to ensure that it returns true when the exists() method is called on it. This is important within the scope of the application to ensure that primary keys are not duplicated. The method is annotated with \textit{@Test}. The methods \textit{assertTrue} and \textit{assertFalse} expect a return value of true and false respectively. They take two parameters: an error message and a boolean value, or a method that returns a boolean value. In the \textit{assertTrue} method below, the UserDAO will return true if the user exists. In the event that the user does not exist, it will fail the test and return the message "User should exist".\newline 

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
@Test
public void testExists(){
	userDAO.createUser(user1);
	assertTrue("User should exist", userDAO.exists(user1.getUsername()));
	assertFalse("User should not exist", userDAO.exists("jkljfksakfjahghdsopjclkhfkjafhkjdshFHajhgouwe"));
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{JUnit UserDAO Exists() Test}
\end{table}

Another test with the UserDAO was to ensure that users were being saved correctly. In this example, users are being created and saved to the database. The method \textit{assertEquals} checks two interger values and returns an error message if they do not match.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
@Test 
public void testCreateRetrieve(){
	userDAO.createUser(user1);
	List<User> users1 = userDAO.getAllUsers();
	assertEquals("One user should have been created and retrieved", 1, users1.size());
	assertEquals("Inserted user should match retrieved", user1, users1.get(0));
	userDAO.createUser(user2);
	userDAO.createUser(user3);
	userDAO.createUser(user4);
	List<User> users2 = userDAO.getAllUsers();
	assertEquals("Number of users should be four", 4, users2.size());
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{JUnit Create and Size Test}
\end{table}
