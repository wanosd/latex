\section{General Introduction - This whole section needs to be reworks, place holder from interim}
This project concerns the development of a web application using a web framework in conjunction with a number of other tools. Throughout development, there is a particular cognisance towards the support of Non-Functional Requirements [NFRs] by both the web framework and the supporting tools throughout the development process.

The main goal of this project is to reflectively analyse a WAF [Web Application Framework], and architecture stack, in the creation of a website. This will be analysed in respect to both functional and non-functional requirements. Two key requirements are extensibility and maintenance. Extensibility refers to the ability of the framework to allow added functionality to the web application without having to modify the core workings of the application. Maintenance refers to the upkeep of the code, and facilitates the modification of the source code after the product is deployed. This may be to correct faults, improve attributes such as performance and security.
The creative driver of the project is the development of a website to meet the requirements and needs of Monaleen Tennis Club, for both members of the club and of the committee. These needs will overlap as all committee representatives are all club members, but not all members are on the committee. From this, it was important to identify the precise requirements for each type of user. The main focus of this project was for the club to be able to perform their core functions through the website. This extended to the registration of members, a timetable for the courts, the creation and distribution of tournament schedules, the organisation and timetabling of training sessions, a method to contact all members and a news section to update and advise members of changes and upcoming events .

\section{Objectives}

\subsection{Primary Objectives}

The primary objectives of this project are the support for quality attributes that the use of an architectural stack provides. The architectural stack within this project contains Spring MVC, Hibernate ORM and Apache Tile. This project will examine the support provided for Security, Performance, Extensibility and Performance provided by these frameworks with cognisance of usability. 

\subsection{Secondary Objectives}

-knowledge of web application development
-practical experience with a popular arch stack
-the use of metrics and code visualisation to aid development

\section{Overview of Report}



\section{Motivation}

The motivation behind this project for me was to examine, understand and work with software frameworks and methodologies that would be commonly used in industry, and to develop a software application from them. The module, Distributed Systems, touched on some of the tools and technologies, Netbeans and EJB respectively, used in relation to Java Enterprise development, and this formed the foundation of my interest in the area. I felt the FYP was a perfect vehicle to supplement my knowledge of this subject, with particular attention being paid to popular and in demand technologies.
