\subsection{Users}

The User class was designed with the existing application form of Monaleen Tennis Club as a foundation. 
Spring handles security a number of ways. Firstly, it uses an \textit{authority} hierarchy to separate different levels of users. For this web application, there were three main levels of authority, with one level containing three different branches.
